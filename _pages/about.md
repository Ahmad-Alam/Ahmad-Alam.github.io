I'm a data scientist and Computer Science student at Punjab University Lahore, specializing in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. With four years of Python experience and a strong foundation in data analysis libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I develop solutions that bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful decisions.

My analytical approach combines systematic problem decomposition with creative thinking, allowing me to tackle challenges ranging from human rights data analysis to cultural trends exploration. Currently, I'm analyzing the HDX dataset for Pakistan, focusing on creating impactful visualizations and extracting valuable insights.

I'm passionate about using data science to drive positive change, whether through analyzing social patterns, developing efficient solutions, or uncovering hidden trends. As an aspiring digital nomad, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my technical expertise while contributing to meaningful projects.

My toolkit includes Python, data visualization, statistical analysis, and a perpetual curiosity for turning numbers into narratives. I'm always open to collaboration and new challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible with data.
