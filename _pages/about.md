I'm a data scientist and Computer Science student at Punjab University Lahore, specializing in data analysis and visualization. With four years of Python experience and expertise in data analysis libraries, I transform complex datasets into actionable insights. My current focus includes analyzing social impact data and developing data-driven solutions.

I combine systematic problem-solving with technical expertise in Python, statistical analysis, and data visualization to deliver meaningful results. Currently working on the HDX dataset analysis for Pakistan, I'm passionate about leveraging data science for impactful solutions while pursuing opportunities that combine technical innovation with practical applications.
