AI/ML Engineer with expertise in large language models, knowledge graph systems, and full-stack development. I build production AI systems including legal document analysis pipelines and e-commerce automation platforms, with a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, and API development.

Currently at VaconAI, I work on AI-powered legal knowledge graph systems processing deposition transcripts using GPT-4 and Neo4j, hybrid entity resolution pipelines, and serverless inference deployments on Modal.com. My experience spans from developing end-to-end medical transport management systems to building inventory automation microservices with GCP integration.
