The thought of looking back on my past thoughts and experiences, understanding my patterns, and tracking my personal growth has always appealed to me. Yet, like many others with ADHD, the actual practice of consistent journaling felt like an insurmountable task – another item on the endless to-do list that would eventually be forgotten or procrastinated away.</p> <p>This tension between wanting to journal and struggling to maintain the habit led me to create <a href="https://github.com/Ahmad-Alam/daily-journal-cli">Daily Journal CLI</a>, a minimalist, markdown-based journaling system designed specifically for people who find traditional journaling overwhelming.</p> <h2 id="the-problem-with-traditional-journaling">The Problem with Traditional Journaling</h2> <p>The classic approach to journaling – sitting down with a blank page and pouring out your thoughts – can be particularly challenging for people with ADHD or attention difficulties. The lack of structure can be paralyzing, and the open-ended nature of the task often leads to:</p> <ul> <li>Analysis paralysis when facing a blank page</li> <li>Forgetting to journal regularly</li> <li>Inconsistent entries that make it hard to track patterns</li> <li>Difficulty maintaining the habit long-term</li> </ul> <h2 id="a-data-scientists-solution">A Data Scientist’s Solution</h2> <p>Given my background in data science, I wanted to create a system that would not only make journaling more accessible but also generate meaningful data that I could analyze over time. The solution I developed combines several key elements:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Structured Templates</strong>: Instead of facing a blank page, each journal entry comes with pre-defined sections and prompting questions</li> <li><strong>Quantifiable Metrics</strong>: Daily ratings for focus, energy, mood, and productivity that can be tracked over time</li> <li><strong>Easy Access</strong>: A keyboard shortcut (Super+Shift+N) that instantly opens today’s journal entry</li> <li><strong>Automatic Organization</strong>: Entries automatically organized by year and date</li> <li><strong>Data-Driven Insights</strong>: Monthly tracking sections that help identify patterns in focus, productivity, and health habits</li> </ol> <h2 id="the-technical-implementation">The Technical Implementation</h2> <p>The system is built using bash scripts and integrates seamlessly with the i3 window manager. Here’s a look at the core structure:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/journal/
├── YYYY/
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD.md
│   └── ...
└── template.md
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Each day’s entry is created from a template that includes sections for:</p> <ul> <li>Daily metrics (1-5 scale ratings)</li> <li>Personal check-ins</li> <li>Achievement tracking</li> <li>Health monitoring</li> <li>Social connections</li> <li>Monthly trends</li> <li>Free writing</li> <li>Quick todos</li> </ul> <h2 id="making-data-collection-fun">Making Data Collection Fun</h2> <p>One of my favorite aspects of this system is how it turns self-reflection into a data collection opportunity. Each entry captures metrics like:</p> <ul> <li>Focus Rating (1-5)</li> <li>Energy Level (1-5)</li> <li>Mood Start and End (1-5)</li> <li>Productivity Score (1-5)</li> <li>Sleep Quality (1-5)</li> <li>Exercise Duration</li> <li>Screen Time</li> <li>Water Intake</li> </ul> <p>These data points can be analyzed at the end of each month to identify patterns and trends in personal well-being and productivity.</p> <h2 id="the-human-element">The Human Element</h2> <p>While the system is data-driven, I made sure to include sections that capture the more nuanced, emotional aspects of daily life:</p> <ul> <li>“What made me smile today?”</li> <li>“What frustrated me most?”</li> <li>“Did I feel overwhelmed? When?”</li> <li>“What helped me feel calm/centered?”</li> </ul> <p>These questions help preserve the sentimental value of traditional journaling while maintaining the structure that makes it ADHD-friendly.</p> <h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2> <p>This project is personal – it’s my attempt to bridge the gap between wanting to preserve my thoughts and struggles with maintaining consistent habits. By combining data science principles with personal reflection, I’ve created a system that feels both meaningful and manageable.</p> <p>The code is open-source and available on GitHub, and I welcome contributions from others who might want to adapt it to their own journaling needs. After all, everyone’s journey with personal reflection is different, and the tools we use should be as unique as we are.</p> <p>Will I stick with it? Only time (and my monthly data analysis) will tell. But by building a system that works with my brain rather than against it, I’ve given myself the best chance of maintaining this valuable practice.</p> <h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try It Yourself</h2> <p>If you’re interested in trying this journaling system, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Ahmad-Alam/daily-journal-cli">GitHub repository</a> for installation instructions and documentation. The system is particularly well-suited for Linux users who use the i3 window manager, but the concepts can be adapted for other environments as well.</p> <p>Remember, the goal isn’t perfect consistency – it’s about making self-reflection more accessible and gathering interesting data along the way. Sometimes, that’s all we need to build a sustainable habit.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="projects"/><category term="programming"/><category term="personal-project"/><category term="cli"/><category term="bash"/><category term="goals"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I created a minimal, data-driven journaling system to overcome ADHD challenges and track personal growth]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Uncovering Lahore’s Property Market Patterns</title><link href="https://ahmad-alam.github.io/blog/2024/lahore-real-estate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Uncovering Lahore’s Property Market Patterns"/><published>2024-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ahmad-alam.github.io/blog/2024/lahore-real-estate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ahmad-alam.github.io/blog/2024/lahore-real-estate/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="beyond-the-numbers-understanding-lahores-real-estate-landscape">Beyond the Numbers: Understanding Lahore’s Real Estate Landscape</h1> <p>The real estate market in Lahore tells a fascinating story of urban development, cultural preferences, and economic patterns. After diving deep into data from over 17,500 property listings, I’ve uncovered some surprising insights about Pakistan’s second-largest city and its housing market. For those interested in the technical details of this analysis, including the complete code and methodology, you can find the detailed project documentation <a href="https://ahmad-alam.github.io/projects/lahore-property-analysis/">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-heart-of-lahores-housing-culture">The Heart of Lahore’s Housing Culture</h2> <p>One of the most striking things about Lahore’s real estate market is how it reflects the city’s strong family-oriented culture. The overwhelming preference for 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom homes isn’t just about square footage – it’s a reflection of the multigenerational living arrangements that are deeply woven into Pakistani society. These homes often accommodate extended families, with spaces that can be both private and communal.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/bedrooms-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/bedrooms-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/bedrooms-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/projects/bedrooms.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Distribution of Rooms" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Distribution of bedrooms and bathrooms across properties in Lahore </div> <p>Houses dominate the market, but what’s particularly interesting is the thriving market for “portions” – upper and lower sections of houses that are rented out separately. This unique feature of Lahore’s real estate landscape speaks to both the entrepreneurial spirit of homeowners and the practical solutions that have evolved to address housing demands in a growing city.</p> <h2 id="geospatial-analysis-and-price-distribution">Geospatial Analysis and Price Distribution</h2> <p>Inspired by the innovative approach of Truong et al. <a class="citation" href="#TRUONG2020433">(Truong et al., 2020)</a> in their housing price prediction study, I implemented a geospatial analysis of Lahore’s property market. Using Google’s Geocoding API, I mapped each property’s location to its corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates. This allowed me to create a comprehensive visualization of price distributions across the city.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/location-heatmap-lahore-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/location-heatmap-lahore-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/location-heatmap-lahore-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/projects/location-heatmap-lahore.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Property Price Distribution" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Geospatial distribution of property prices across Lahore. Color intensity indicates price levels. </div> <h2 id="the-price-paradox">The Price Paradox</h2> <p>Perhaps the most intriguing finding is what I call the “suburban premium paradox.” Conventional wisdom suggests that properties closest to the city center should command the highest prices. While this holds true for properties very close to the center (averaging PKR 86,700), there’s an unexpected twist: properties far from the center actually command higher prices than those moderately close to it.</p> <p>This pattern reveals the emergence of high-end suburban developments in Lahore. Areas that might have once been considered “too far” are now becoming prestigious addresses, complete with modern amenities and planned communities. It’s a sign of how Lahore is growing not just outward, but upward in terms of luxury and desirability.</p> <h2 id="the-value-game">The Value Game</h2> <p>What really drives property values in Lahore? While location matters, the data reveals that Lahoris place a premium on bathrooms and bedrooms almost equally. This makes sense when you consider the local lifestyle – large family gatherings are common, and having adequate facilities is often as important as having enough bedrooms.</p> <p>Farm houses, while representing a small segment of the market, tell an interesting story about luxury living in Lahore. With an average size of 22.5 Marlas, these properties are massive compared to standard homes. Yet their pricing doesn’t always reflect their size, suggesting they serve as weekend retreats or status symbols rather than primary residences.</p> <h2 id="the-evolution-of-urban-living">The Evolution of Urban Living</h2> <p>The significant presence of flats in the market (over 2,000 listings) signals a gradual shift in Lahore’s urban landscape. While traditionally a city of houses, the growing acceptance of apartment living suggests a modernizing mindset, particularly among younger residents. However, the price points of flats (median of PKR 42,000) indicate they’re positioned as middle-market options rather than luxury choices.</p> <h2 id="reading-between-the-numbers">Reading Between the Numbers</h2> <p>What makes this analysis particularly fascinating is how it reveals the intersection of tradition and transformation in Lahore. The property market isn’t just responding to supply and demand – it’s adapting to changing family structures, evolving lifestyle preferences, and the city’s rapid expansion.</p> <p>For investors and homebuyers, understanding these patterns is crucial. The sweet spot in Lahore’s market isn’t just about finding the right price point – it’s about understanding the social and cultural factors that drive value. A property’s worth isn’t just in its square footage or location, but in how well it serves the unique needs of Lahori families and their way of life.</p> <h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2> <p>As Lahore continues to grow and evolve, these patterns will likely shift. The rise of suburban premium areas suggests a city that’s reimagining its boundaries. The steady demand for family-sized homes indicates the enduring strength of traditional living arrangements. And the emerging apartment market hints at new possibilities for urban living.</p> <p>The story of Lahore’s real estate market is, in many ways, the story of Lahore itself – a city balancing tradition with transformation, family values with modern aspirations, and organic growth with planned development. For anyone interested in understanding urban development in South Asia, Lahore offers a fascinating case study of how housing markets adapt to and reflect social change.</p> <p>Note: This analysis was conducted using Python and pandas, examining a dataset of over 17,500 property listings across Lahore. All prices are in Pakistani Rupees (PKR). The geospatial analysis methodology was inspired by the work of Truong et al. <a class="citation" href="#TRUONG2020433">(Truong et al., 2020)</a>.
