The Lahore Rental Market Analysis Dashboard offers an interactive exploration of property rental patterns in Pakistan's cultural capital. Built using Tableau, this visualization tool combines geographical analysis with detailed property metrics to provide valuable insights.

The dashboard consists of four key visualizations: a geographic heat map showing property distribution and price variations across Lahore; a property type distribution analysis revealing that houses dominate the market at 38.5%, followed by upper portions at 31.6%; a price distribution histogram highlighting that most properties cluster around PKR 65,891; and a room configuration matrix showing that 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom properties are the most common in the market.

All visualizations are interconnected through Tableau's interactive features. This interactivity enables users to drill down into specific market segments, compare different areas of the city, and identify pricing patterns across various property configurations.
